## An Urban World
As predicted by [Mike Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Davis_(scholar)) in his famous book _Planet of Slums_ in 2007 for the first time the urban population has outnumbered the rural. [1][1] In this process of accelerated urbanization, today, more than 55 percent of the world's population lives in an urban area or city, with that figure set to rise to 68 percent over the coming decades (According to the "[Population Division](https://population.un.org/wpp/)" report from the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs).

Growth in urban population is not equally distributed, the scale and velocity of urbanization in developing countries is unprecedent and astonishing if compared with any other period of human history. The number of megacities has exploded in the last decades changing the world's urban hierarchies and networks. 

However megacities are just one aspect of the urbanization of the world, small and medium size cities are also growing everywhere in the world and they are absorbig the vast majority of the new urban dwellers. 

### World's Megacities

## Informality

## Big Numbers
In this 55 percent-that roughly sums 4.2 Billion people-an estimated 25 percent of the world's urban population lives in informal settlements, with 213 million informal settlement residents added to the global population since 1990 (UN-Habitat, 2013b: 126–8).

And yet, due to the speed, scale, complexity, and singularity nature of informality, the discipline of design and planning still lacks the adequate knowledge and strategies to understand and address this global phenomenon adequately.
